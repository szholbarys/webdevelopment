        <p>"The old part of the city has always been distinguished by its greenery, one might say, lush greenery. Many, of course, will not believe it, but it is a fact. The city was green at one time. This path was shrouded in dense bushes with trees. There was an arch of greenery in which you hid from the sultry sun. The sun bakes here sometimes for 50 degrees, even the asphalt melts. Now there is no former greenery, the city is burned out. In places of shrubs and trees, cars stand randomly, curbs have sunk into the sand.

Old houses look tired and dull, since Soviet times they have been covered with scars from the new reality. And this is, unfortunately, the biggest minus of the city.</p>

        <p>On July 17, we charged all kinds of devices: a drone (although it cannot be used in many places in the USA), a camera, phones, go pro and various flashlights.

The refrigerator was filled with products that the household tried to attack all two days before departure, and I guarded them with the words "don't touch it, it's on a trip!" (that's just like "Don't touch it, it's for the New Year!").

Things were put in the cupboards. We counted the number of children and moved towards Nevada. We left about three hours later than planned. It's difficult to plan time with a bunch of children, but we don't give up and every time we hope that next time we will definitely be able to leave on time!

I apologize in advance for the quality of some photos. At that time, I didn't know that I would soon have a website, so part of the photo is a printscreen from the video.</p>
