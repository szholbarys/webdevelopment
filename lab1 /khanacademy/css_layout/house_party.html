            <li>Buffet
                <br>For the buffet menu, choose snacks that are convenient to eat without a fork and knife. It can be cheese, meat and fish plates, tartlets with salads, toasts and sandwiches, stuffed boiled eggs, chicken medallions, profiteroles, bread with pate.

                <li>During the party<br>
Board games are always a good idea for any party. When everyone has met, eaten and talked, it's time to play. Choose games with simple rules so that everyone can quickly get involved in the process. It can be different games to explain words like “Crocodile" or “Who am I?”, simple sets for noisy companies like “Fridays” or quizzes like “Answer in 5 seconds". 

Think about the musical accompaniment. Prepare a playlist in advance with neutral tracks that will play in the background, and dance tracks that you can move to. Use Soundcloud and iTunes, take out a portable speaker or connect a speaker system – and the atmosphere is created

<li>Home movie show<br>
Gather friends at home to watch a new movie, and then share your impressions. You can choose a movie in advance and jointly or announce the repertoire on the day of the meeting. Alternate arthouse with comedies, discussed novelties with good classics, arrange a marathon of Fellini films or a day of Scandinavian cinema.

Tip: For a movie show, prepare some snacks that are convenient to eat with your hands: sandwiches, pizza, chicken nuggets, meatballs on skewers, French fries, shrimp in batter or tortilla. Don't forget the drinks.
