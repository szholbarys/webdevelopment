        <p>The <em>Flamingo</em> is awesome because <strong>the genus flamingo includes the largest representatives of the family — red and pink flamingos.
             Although Allen believed that the pink flamingo is the largest, and the red one is only slightly inferior in size, modern scientists consider the Caribbean species to be the largest [source not specified 489 days].
              The third representative — the Chilean flamingo — is inferior in size to the Andean of the genus of short—billed flamingos, but larger than the smallest representatives of the family - James's flamingo and the lesser flamingo.
<br>Allen added that the red flamingo has the longest forelock. At the same time, the beaks of birds are almost identical in size.</strong>.</p>
